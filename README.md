## 👨‍💻 Ash Reddy | Coder → Data Scientist

I write code that helps me think better, build faster and solve deeper. My code spans industries, langiages and toolkits — built for reuse across industries, academia and everyday life.

#### 🧱 What I Build
These are designed to work on nearly any real-world dataset — across industry and academic use cases.
- [ML Toolkit](https://ashrithssreddy.github.io/ml-toolkit/) → A curated collection of machine learning workflows with embedded explanations for fast, reusable implementation.
- [Statistics Toolkit](https://ashrithssreddy.github.io/statistics-toolkit/) → Applied statistics workflows with explanatory depth, covering A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and introductory statistics.
- [DataFrame Explorer](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/dataframeexplorer/index.html) → R package to understand dataframes, reducing data coding time by facilitating familiarity before manipulation.

#### 🧠 For Fun
- [tech-tributes](https://github.com/ashrithssreddy/tech-tributes) → Creative writeups that reframe iconic tech stories through data/code.
- [times-of-twitter](https://github.com/ashrithssreddy/times-of-twitter) → Data-driven experiments with social media and timelines.
- [bitcoin-utils](https://github.com/ashrithssreddy/bitcoin-utils) → A playground for analyzing crypto patterns and building lightweight tooling.

#### 🔐 Data Security
- [zero-digital-footprint](https://github.com/ashrithssreddy/zero-digital-footprint) → A practical guide for protecting your privacy and managing your digital footprint.
- [digital-homestead-guide](https://github.com/ashrithssreddy/digital-homestead-guide) → Markdown-based guides for privacy-conscious system setup, software choices and local-first workflows.
