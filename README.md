# 👨‍💻 Ash Reddy | Code-First Data Scientist

I write code that helps me think better, build faster, and solve deeper problems.  
My code spans industries, langiages and toolkits — built for reuse across industries, academia, and everyday life.

#### 🧱 What I Build
These are designed to work on nearly any real-world dataset — across industry and academic use cases.
- [ML Toolkit](https://github.com/ashrithssreddy/ml-toolkit) → A curated collection of machine learning workflows with embedded explanations for fast, reusable implementation.
- [Statistics Toolkit](https://github.com/ashrithssreddy/statistics-toolkit) → Applied statistics workflows with explanatory depth, covering A/B testing, hypothesis testing, and introductory statistics.
- [DataFrame Explorer](https://github.com/ashrithssreddy/dataframe-explorer) → R package to understand dataframes, reducing data coding time by facilitating familiarity before manipulation.

#### 🧠 For Fun & Mental Sharpness
- [tech-tributes](https://github.com/ashrithssreddy/tech-tributes): Creative writeups that reframe iconic tech stories through data/code.
- [times-of-twitter](https://github.com/ashrithssreddy/times-of-twitter): Data-driven experiments with social media and timelines.
- [bitcoin-utils](https://github.com/ashrithssreddy/bitcoin-utils): A playground for analyzing crypto patterns and building lightweight tooling.

#### 🔐 Digital Security Learnings
